Questions and notes:

see notes in docs for consumer.on("layerschange") about detecting
deactivation due to bandwidth. haven't been able to trigger this in
testing

AudioLevelObserver 'silence' is not a documented event. submit a docs
patch a paused producer still seems to send a fair amount of
bytes. does pausing not stop all simulcast tracks? some evidence for
this in that setting producer send to the lowest simulcast layer, then
pausing, seems to send at much lower bandwidth than pausing without
limiting simulcast to lowest layer, first

firefox seems not to respect setMaxSpatialLayers

what's the best way to set maximum bitrate for screen shares?  (chrome
75 crashes if multiple encodings are provided for screen share
streams?)

"no Producer for received SDES chunk" after calling producer.close()
on both server and client (both Chrome and Firefox)

"no Consumer found for received Receiver report" when consuming a
simulcast stream

inital "no Producer" messages while hooking up stream

firefox video rotation issue?

use h264 when sending from mobile safari?
